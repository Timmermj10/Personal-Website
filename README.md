# Personal-Website
My progress on a personal website that I will be building

This is where I will be writing code pertaining to a personal website. I hope to learn a lot about GitHub, version control, GIT, HTML/CSS,
and other best practices through this challenge!

Began work on website on November 23, 2022.
